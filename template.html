The use of generative AI in academic environments must be considered with care. A good rule to keep in mind that using generative AI to replace what a human could do might conflict with general rules of

<strong><a href="https://lss.ucsc.edu/programs/modified-supplemental-instruction/index.html" target="_blank">Modified Supplemental Instruction (MSI) </a></strong>
</p>
<p class="text13">In MSI, you can expect the MSI leader to facilitate cooperative group activities designed to have students work together on the course content. MSI is offered at least three times each week for the entire quarter. The MSI leader is an undergraduate student who took the class, did well, and is trained to facilitate group sessions to focus on you, the students, and what you need to succeed in the course. LSS provides continuous training for MSI leaders to create inclusive spaces for students and facilitate group work effectively. MSI is for everyone and open to all students in class to get extra practice on the things you already know or the things you want to know better. Attendance is voluntary; however, students who attend MSI sessions weekly earn a higher final grade than students who do not participate in MSI.

UC Santa Cruz is committed to creating an academic environment that
supports its diverse student body. If you are a student with a disability who requires
accommodations to achieve equal access in this course, please submit your Accommodation
Authorization Letter from the Disability Resource Center (DRC) to me privately during my
office hours or by appointment, preferably within the first two weeks of the quarter.  At that
time, I would also like us to discuss ways we can ensure your full participation in the course.   I
encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC services to contact DRC
by phone at 831-459-2089 or by email at <a href="mailto:drc@ucsc.edu">drc@ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
<strong>Was there a curve last quarter?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. We don't do curves in this class.
</p>

<p><strong>This Homework problem is impossible to do without a calculator. What should I do if it's on the Exam?</strong></p>
<p>If a Homework problem really is impossible to do without a calculator, it won't be on the Exam.</p>
</li>-->
<!--
<li>
<p><strong>I have class all the way over on the other side of campus before your class. Can I come in a few minutes late?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, just be courteous to your classmates and be as quiet as possible when you come in.</p>
</li>
